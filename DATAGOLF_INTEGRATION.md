3. Add your API key to the backend environment variables:

```bash
# Backend environment (.env file)
DATAGOLF_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The backend integration is already implemented with the following endpoints:

```bash
# Tournament endpoints
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/recent?tour=pga&limit=20
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/schedule?tour=all
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/{tour}/{event_id}/{year}/leaderboard
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/live/predictions?tour=pga
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/live/stats
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/test

# Player endpoints
GET /api/v1/players/datagolf/list
GET /api/v1/players/datagolf/rankings
GET /api/v1/players/datagolf/with-rankings
GET /api/v1/players/datagolf/skill-ratings?display=value
```

### 3. Frontend Components

New components created:

- `SortableTable`: Reusable sortable table component
- `useDataGolf`: Custom hooks for API data fetching
- Updated `Tournaments.tsx`: Tournament data with tabs
- Updated `Players.tsx`: Player rankings and skill ratings

## Data Sources

The integration uses multiple DataGolf API endpoints:

1. **Historical Raw Data**: Tournament results and round-by-round data
2. **Rankings & Predictions**: Player rankings and tournament predictions
3. **Live Data**: Real-time tournament statistics and predictions
4. **General Data**: Player lists, schedules, and field updates

## Features by Page

**Recent Tournaments Tab:**

- Sortable table with tournament name, year, tour, completion date
- Tour filtering (PGA, DP World, Korn Ferry, LIV)
- Search functionality
- Refresh capability

**Tournament Schedule Tab:**

- Upcoming tournaments with course information

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling implemented:

- **API Connection Errors**: Clear error messages when DataGolf API is unreachable
- **Authentication Errors**: Specific messaging for API key issues
- **Data Loading Errors**: User-friendly error alerts with retry options
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper handling of API rate limits

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Operations**: All API calls are asynchronous
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
- **Caching**: Frontend data is cached until manual refresh
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are handled with appropriate limits

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Test API Connection

```bash
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/test
```

This endpoint tests the DataGolf API connection and returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "DataGolf API connection successful",
  "sample_data_length": 3885,
  "api_configured": true
}
  "message": "DataGolf API connection successful",
  "sample_data_length": 1234,
  "api_configured": true
}
```

### 2. Verify Frontend Integration

1. Navigate to the Tournaments page
2. Check that recent tournaments load
3. Test tour filtering functionality
4. Navigate to the Players page
5. Verify player rankings display
6. Test skill ratings tab

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"DataGolf API key not configured"**

   - Ensure `DATAGOLF_API_KEY` is set in your environment
   - Restart the backend server after adding the key

2. **"Authentication failed"**

   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check that your DataGolf subscription is active

3. **"No data available"**

   - DataGolf API might be temporarily unavailable
   - Check the test endpoint to verify connectivity

4. **Rate limiting errors**
   - DataGolf has rate limits on API calls
   - Wait a few seconds between requests

### Debug Steps

1. Check backend logs for detailed error messages
2. Use the test endpoint to verify API connectivity
3. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
4. Check network connectivity to DataGolf API

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the integration:

1. **Historical Tournament Detail Pages**: Click on tournaments to see detailed leaderboards
2. **Player Profile Pages**: Individual player pages with career statistics
3. **Live Tournament Updates**: Real-time updates during tournaments
4. **Betting Integration**: Combine with odds data for betting features
5. **Fantasy Integration**: Use DataGolf data for fantasy golf features
6. **Data Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
7. **Tournament Notifications**: Alerts for tournament start times and results

## API Rate Limits

DataGolf API has the following considerations:

- API calls are metered based on your subscription
- Implement appropriate caching to minimize API calls
- Use the test endpoint sparingly
- Consider implementing request queuing for high-traffic scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "DataGolf API key not configured" Error

**Problem**: API key environment variable not set
**Solution**:

- Add `DATAGOLF_API_KEY=your_key_here` to your `.env` file
- Restart the backend server after adding the key
- Test with `/api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/test` endpoint

#### 2. Recent Tournaments Showing Empty Array

**Problem**: Date filtering logic excludes available tournaments  
**Solution**: This was fixed to properly include tournaments from 2024 and completed 2025 events

#### 3. Players Data Not Loading

**Problem**: API response structure mismatch  
**Solution**: Fixed response models to match actual DataGolf API responses (lists vs objects)

#### 4. "'list' object has no attribute 'get'" Error

**Problem**: Code expecting dictionaries but receiving lists from DataGolf API  
**Solution**: Updated service methods to handle proper response types

### Debug Endpoints

Use these endpoints to troubleshoot data issues:

```bash
# Test API connection
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/test

# View raw historical events
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/debug/events

# View 2024 tournaments specifically
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/debug/2024-events

# Test tournament schedule
GET /api/v1/tournaments/datagolf/debug/schedule
```

### Verification Steps

1. **API Key**: Test endpoint returns `api_configured: true`
2. **Recent Tournaments**: Should show 2024-2025 completed tournaments
3. **Player Data**: Should return 3000+ players with rankings
4. **Schedule**: Should show upcoming 2025 tournaments

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### DataGolf Subscription Upgrade

**Benefits:**

- Complete historical tournament database
- Accurate betting odds (valuable for your users)
- Professional-grade data quality
- API reliability and support

**Considerations:**

- Monthly/annual subscription cost
- May be essential for serious golf betting application
